## [[CBA]] tech notes
### Dilution factor vs concentration
#### Samples dilution factor:
##### Factor for use in final calculations
##### Same value for all samples/analytes
### Replicates and necessary maths
#### Calculate concentration and then group replicates and do stats like standard deviation
### Sample validation:
#### Text/meta data properties that must be the same?
##### only ones that make the math go
##### Dimensions
#### Warn user but don't stop
##### Experiment name?
##### Cytometer name?
##### export date?
##### ??
## [[CBA]] PRD refinement
### add ability to copy and edit a template
### pdf export of snapshot
### maybe only need to cluster debris on 1 dimension
### need to support FCS 3.1 files
